# Getting Started with Nuxt 3 Server Routes

## Building an API with Server Routes (Basic)

The `server/` directory allows Nuxt create powerful backend APIs using the modern [`Nitro Engine`](https://nitro.unjs.io/). Due to the power of the auto-import feature Nuxt is designed to scan files in the following `api/`, `routes/`, `middleware/` and `plugins/` - to register APIs and server handlers.

Files in these folders accept an event as their first argument which comes from the H3 Utilities. This can be defined in a function that handles the event - `defineEventHandler()` or `eventHandler()`.

## Creating a Server Route

In this tutorial we will break our API based on the folder structure for the `server/` directory. 

- `server/`
  - `api/`
  - `routes/`
  - `middleware/`
  - `plugins/`

### Creating a Server Route in the `api/` folder

The files in the `api/` folder are prefixed with the `api/` in the route path. For example, if we have a file called `api/todo` it will be available at `http://localhost:3000/api/todos`. 

```ts [server/api/todos.ts]
export default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {
    // @ts-ignore
    const _recipes: RecipeTodo = sampleData
    const status = getResponseStatus(event)
    return {
        status,
        message: "Success",
        data: _recipes
    }
})
```
With this API route in place we can access it on our pages and components using the data fetching method [`useFetch`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/composables/use-fetch)

```vue [pages/index.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
const _recipeTodo = await useFetch('api/todos')
</script>
```


Let us rework this example and make it more readable and reusable. We can create a new directory in the `api/` folder called `todos/` and create a file called `index.ts` in it. This will allow us to create multiple routes for the `todos` API.

```ts [server/api/todos/index.ts]
export default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {
    // @ts-ignore
    const _recipes: RecipeTodo = sampleData
    const status = getResponseStatus(event)
    return {
        status,
        message: "Success",
        data: _recipes
    }
})
```

With this we can now create a new file called `createTodo.post.ts` in the `todos/` folder. This will allow us to create a new route for creating a todo. (Note: This is similar to how pages are created.)

`Note: The file name can be suffixed with a HTTP method.`


```ts [server/api/todos/createTodo.post.ts]
export default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {
    // Handle request with body
    const body = await readBody(event);

    const { title, description }: Partial<RecipeTodo> = body;

    // @ts-ignore
    const _recipes: RecipeTodo = {
        id: uuidv4(),
        title: title,
        description: description,
    }

    const status = getResponseStatus(event)
    sampleData.push(_recipes)
    return {
        status,
        message: "Success",
        data: sampleData
    }
});
```
Note: The `readBody` function is a helper function that allows us to read the body of the request. This is similar to the `req.body` in Express. This function (like so many others - `getResponseStatus()`) are available from the H3 utilities.

### Creating a Server Route in the `routes/` folder

Similar to the `api/` folder, the files in the `routes/` create the API route path without `api/` prefix. For example, if we have a file called `routes/todo` it will be available at `http://localhost:3000/routes/todos`. 

```ts [server/routes/todos.ts]
export default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {
    // @ts-ignore
    const _recipes: RecipeTodo = sampleData
    const status = getResponseStatus(event)
    return {
        status,
        message: "Success",
        data: _recipes
    }
})
```

### Creating a Server Middleware 

Files in the `middleware/` will be automatically registered as a middleware in Nuxt. Middleware handlers will be called before the API handlers. 

Note: Middleware handlers should not return a response. They should only inspect or extend the request or give an error.

```ts [server/middleware/logger.ts]
export default defineEventHandler((event) => {
  console.log('New request: ' + getRequestURL(event))
})
```

Another example:

```ts [server/middleware/todoMiddleware.ts]

export default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {
    try {
        // const data = await $fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos')
        // console.log(data)
        event.context.data = sampleData.length
    } catch (e) {
        console.error(e)
        sendError(event, createError({
            statusCode: 401,
            statusMessage: "Unauthorized",
        }))
    }

});
```

### Creating a Server Plugin

Files in the `plugins/` will be automatically registered as a plugin in Nuxt. Plugins are useful for extending the functionality of the server. 

```ts [server/plugins/logger.ts]
export default defineEventHandler((event) => {
  console.log('New request: ' + getRequestURL(event))
})
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial we explored the `server/` directory and how to use it to create server routes. We also explored the different types of files that can be created in the `server/` directory and how to use them.
